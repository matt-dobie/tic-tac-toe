# Tic-Tac-Toe
This game was developed as one of <a href="http://www.freecodecamp.com" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp's</a> advanced front-end projects. The goal was to create my own playable version of Tic-Tac-Toe. It includes a multiplayer mode for the user to play against a friend, as well as a single-player mode with four different levels of difficulty. To achieve this I had to build an AI system in JavaScript based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax" target="_blank">Minimax Algorithm</a> - one that allows the computer to actually decide what is the best move to make during its turn. This was by far the most challenging and exciting aspect of the project. Check it out at mattdobie.com, and let me know if you manage to beat the 'Master' difficulty level in single-player (Hint: It should be impossible)!
